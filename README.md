# No More Next Line Character

Ever feel annoyed when the line just doesn't match up when copy & pasteing from pdf? Well lucky for you here's the solution! Instead of doing all this manually, why not let a simple extension that do it for you?

### What does this extension do?
Simple! Just remove all those new line character in a given text, either from your clipboard or your input. A shortcut is also avaliable so no need to click that icon every time.

### How to use it?
** will finish this part when upload to extension store

** waiting for publish

### Privacy of my clipboard?
Fortunately due to my lack of knowledge, there's not a single bit of database deploying knowledge I know of, and hence your clipboard is 100% safe. It's not likely for me to update this extension other fixing some bug later, plus the source code is just right above, feel free to see what's in there if in doubt.

### How do I know what error I'm having?
The text below the input box should give an intuitive message about what's going on. For the erroe encounter when using the short cut: 

First of all make sure you have pin the extension, and pay attention to when the badge on the icon turns red. Hover your key onto the icon to see the error message.

Anything that's other than no text in clipboard, make a issue thread so I can fix it.
